I was starting to get worried about my roommate, John. Every morning, he would wake up in strange places around the apartment, with no memory of how he got there. It was starting to affect his work, as he was constantly tired and unable to focus. As we struggled to figure out what was going on, we soon discovered the unsettling truth. He had unknowingly taken up sleepwalking as a nighttime hobby.
Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a sleep disorder that impacts an individual's ability to remain asleep throughout the night without trying to attempt risky behavior. People who experience sleepwalking may perform activities such as walking, sitting up, or moving items without being conscious of their actions. This can have a profound impact on the individual's safety and wellbeing, as well as the safety of those around them. The overpass went under the highway and into a secret world.
Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a sleep disorder that causes people to get up and walk around while they are still asleep. It usually occurs during the deep stages of sleep and can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, sleep deprivation, stress, and alcohol consumption. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, an estimated 3.6% of adults and 7% of children experience sleepwalking. It is more common in children, especially those between the ages of 4-8, and tends to run in families. Some individuals may also experience sleepwalking as a symptom of other sleep disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea. He found his art never progressed when he literally used his sweat and tears.
My personal experience with sleepwalking is both concerning and comical. My brother has been a sleepwalker for as long as I can remember, and there have been numerous incidents that still make us laugh to this day. He once made himself a sandwich and left it on a neighbor's doorstep, thinking it was a gift for them. Another time, he tried to water the plants in our living room with a bottle of ketchup. It was always dangerous to drive with him since he insisted the safety cones were a slalom course.
