As a child, he loved spending time in his grandparents' orchard, eagerly plucking ripe fruit from the branches. The smell of the earth and the warmth of the sun filled him with a sense of bliss. But as he grew older, the longing for simple pleasures faded beneath the weight of responsibilities. He yearned for the days when the biggest worry was deciding which tree to climb next. He dreamed of eating green apples with worms.
Jacob had always dreamed of eating green apples. The tart, crisp taste and vibrant color had captured his imagination since he was a young boy. Growing up in the city, he had never had the chance to taste a fresh, juicy green apple straight from the tree. Now, as a young camper in the countryside, surrounded by orchards and farms, his dream was finally within reach. Homesickness became contagious in the young campers' cabin.
As she reached for a green apple from the tree, the sun glistened off its smooth skin, making it look almost ethereal. But when she took a bite, she was greeted with the unmistakable crunch of a worm. As she looked around, she realized that most of the apples had subtle holes, evidence of their unwelcome guests. The contrast of the vibrant green against the decay within made her stomach turn. She couldn't understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.
As the character lay in bed, they couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment and frustration towards their dream. The dream had been so vivid and delightful, it felt almost tangible. But as they woke up and reality set in, the warmth of the dream was quickly replaced by a sense of longing and unattainability. It left them feeling deprived and wanting. There was no ice cream in the freezer, nor did they have money to go to the store.
