After years of hard work, Maria finally achieved her dream of getting a promotion at work. She had proven herself time and time again, and now her dedication had paid off. However, as she sat at her desk, she realized that there was no one to celebrate with. Her friends had all moved away, and her family was too caught up in their own lives to be excited for her. She had some amazing news to share but nobody to share it with.
I want to introduce you to my friend, Lily. She's always been a dreamer, but today she's especially excited. She just found out that she's been accepted into the art program at her dream college! She's been talking about it for weeks, and now her hard work has finally paid off. As we were walking home from school, she gazed up at the sky, pointing out all the different colors and shapes in the clouds. She couldn't understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy.
She sat alone in her room, feeling the weight of her isolation and the lack of someone to share her news with. No one seemed to understand or care about her experiences and accomplishments. She longed for someone to confide in and share her joys and struggles with. It seemed like an insurmountable task to find someone who truly understood her and was genuinely interested in her life. Each person who knows you has a different perception of who you are.
As she sat alone in her apartment, she couldn't help but feel the heavy weight of loneliness and frustration settling in. The countless nights spent scrolling through social media and longing for meaningful connections left her feeling empty and isolated. Despite her efforts to reach out and make plans, it seemed that everyone was too busy or uninterested. She yearned for the warmth of companionship and the understanding of someone who truly cared. It was in this moment of despair that she realized she could no longer allow herself to remain in this state of despair. He decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses he'd used until then.
